          This 5-month learning intervention equips veterans with the skills,

          roles of their choice. The programme helps learners align their life
          experiences with job responsibilities and leverage their competencies
          for success in the corporate world. The programme participants will
          acquire business, managerial, and leadership skills to build a

          corporate strategies. The programme also enables the learners to

          perceptions, and break free from stereotypes. The programme will
          conclude with an assessment for certification purposes, which will be
          followed by a Graduation Ceremony.

            Module 11: Operations Management<br></br>
            Operations strategy consists of the strategic use of functions such as manufacturing, supply chain, or service provision. Traditionally, these areas have been viewed as narrow, functional areas, and management of them was based on some simple criteria such as cost minimization. <br></br>
            More recently, managers and business observers have understood that operations must be managed in the broader context of business strategy. In this sense, decisions on operations capabilities must fit and be consistent with the business strategy and consider the competitive environment<br></br>

            •	Evaluate the importance of perishable asset revenue management in optimizing inventory and understand its impact on overall operations.<br></br>
            Moudle 12: Dealing with Ambiguity & Change<br></br>
            Research shows that 70 per cent of all change management initiatives fail to reach the intended target. While planning a change is essential, the pace of an organisation’s growth is directly proportional to the openness of its leaders' approach to accepting change. 
            The ability to bring out change smoothly and effectively is a distinguishing characteristic of successful leaders. This module will help you develop a strategic mindset for embracing and adopting change.<br></br>
            •	Learn to identify the forces for and against change - Appreciate that change involves not only rationality but also emotions and relationships<br></br>

            Every leader is expected to have a complete view of every minute detail of their project, no matter how complex or time-consuming. To deliver a project successfully, it is essential to create a sense of chaos. In the module, you will explore practical ways to explore and understand your goals from the onset of your project and consider all the elements that may affect its execution. <br></br>

            As organisations are flourishing on scaling up globally, shaking hands with global partners for expansion, stakeholder management is becoming a critical skill for every leader today. Who is your right audience? What kind of messaging would lead to a win-win? & how to develop a mutually beneficial working environment? This and so much more. <br></br>

            Module 15: Building a Personal Brand<br></br>
            What will make a leader stand out in a crowd? A leader's ability to inspire confidence, gain trust, motivate & create a long-lasting impact makes them a leader of choice, one whom people would want to follow, trust, and, most importantly, aspire to be like.
